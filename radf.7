.SH "NAME"
radf \- filter markdown based on user-entered markers and selectors
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.B radf
\-b BEGIN_MARKER -e END_MARKER -s SELECTOR
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.PP
.B radf
scans STDIN for lines which contain the BEGIN_MARKER.
.PP
If a line is not contained between BEGIN_MARKER and END_MARKER lines, it is copied directly to STDOUT.
.PP
If a line contains the designated BEGIN_MARKER and additional text, the additonal text is checked to see if it contains SELECTOR.  If a match is found, the lines between the BEGIN_MARKER and the designated END_MARKER are copied to STDOUT.  If not, lines between the markers are not copied to STDOUT.
.PP
Lines containing the BEGIN_MARKER and END_MARKER are never copied to STDOUT.
.PP
The BEGIN_MARKER and END_MARKER can be any desired text that is not contained in the document text.  Note that if the text of either marker is inadvertently included in the document text, processing will likely not produce the desired results.
.PP
Also note that markers can include additional, non-matching information to aid the author, so long as only the common portion of the marker text is identifed to
.B radf
as marker text.  For example, using a passed BEGIN_MARKER of "begin-text" and using combinations such as "begin-text-for-beta-release" and "begin-text-for-final-release" will allow the reader to more thoroughly differentiate the text without limiting the filtering capability.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.PP
A typical sequence of text passages might look like this:
.PP
.RS 4
begin-text-for-beta-release pci-features
.PP
The new PCI features are currently in a Beta state.  This means that the PCI identifiers must fall between 1 and 15 when adding new PCI devices to the system.  Also, there is a limit of 8 PCI devices that can be added to this Beta version.
.PP
end-text
.PP
begin-text-for-final-release pci-features pci-devices
.PP
With the final release of 3.5, you may connect up to 256 PCI devices to the system, with identifiers between 0 and 255.  Additional PCI devices may be added by using an expansion module, described elsewhere.
.PP
end-text
.PP
.RE
Entering a
.B radf
command such as this one:
.PP
.RS 4
radf -b "begin-text" -e "end-text" -s "pci-features"
.PP
.RE
will produce the following text:
.PP
.RS 4

.PP
.RE
Entering the following command, on the other hand:
.PP
.RS 4
radf -b "begin-text" -e "end-text" -s "pci-devices"
.PP
.RE
would produce different text, like this:
.PP
.RS 4
With the final release of 3.5, you may connect up to 256 PCI devices to the system, with identifiers between 0 and 255.  Additional PCI devices may be added by using an expansion module, described elsewhere.
.PP
.RE
Note that the use of "for-final-release" and "for-beta-release" helps the user easily distinguish between passages of text that go wtih different document versions.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
.PP
.B radf
sends its filtered text to STDOUT.
