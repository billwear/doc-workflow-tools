# if the __name__ variable is set to '__main__',
# then this is the main application not a called
# module, so the function main() needs to be run
# in this case; this allows this code to also be
# used as a library, as the imported vesion will
# not have the __name__ set to '__main__', so it
# won't automatically run the main function.  to
# make this useful, we must write the code so it
# doesn't do anything in the main module that we
# might want to do from a library.
